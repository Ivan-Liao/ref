1. Make dataset
   1. `bq mk ecommerce`
2. Test non partitioned dataset
```
#standardSQL
SELECT *
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.partition_by_day`
WHERE date_formatted = '2016-08-01'
```
3. Create partitioned dataset
```
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.partition_by_day
 PARTITION BY date_formatted
 OPTIONS(
   description="a table partitioned by date"
 ) AS

 SELECT DISTINCT
 PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", date) AS date_formatted,
 fullvisitorId
 FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.all_sessions_raw`
```
4. Create a partitioned date table with public weather data
```
#standardSQL
 CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ecommerce.days_with_rain
 PARTITION BY date
 OPTIONS (
   partition_expiration_days=60,
   description="weather stations with precipitation, partitioned by day"
 ) AS


 SELECT
   DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS date,
   (SELECT ANY_VALUE(name) FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.stations` AS stations
    WHERE stations.usaf = stn) AS station_name,  -- Stations may have multiple names
   prcp
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*` AS weather
 WHERE prcp < 99.9  -- Filter unknown values
   AND prcp > 0      -- Filter
   AND _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '2018'
```

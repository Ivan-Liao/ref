- [ ] completeness (presence of primary key in result set from a source set)
- [ ] special character removal
- [ ] fuzzy matching correction
- [ ] data freshness (if rows are timestamped)
- [ ] expected value ranges (can be based on values in other columns, may have dependency considerations)
- [ ] data type conversion
- [ ] format check (regex)

# Additional considerations
- Implement acceptance thresholds
- handling multiple sources of truth
- security concerns
